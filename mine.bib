	abstract = {Machine learning has been a fast growing field of research in several areas dealing with large datasets. We report recent attempts to use Renormalization Group ({RG}) ideas in the context of machine learning. We examine coarse graining procedures for perceptron models designed to identify the digits of the {MNIST} data. We discuss the correspondence between principal components analysis ({PCA}) and {RG} flows across the transition for worm configurations of the 2D Ising model. Preliminary results regarding the logarithmic divergence of the leading {PCA} eigenvalue were presented at the conference and have been improved after. More generally, we discuss the relationship between {PCA} and observables in Monte Carlo simulations and the possibility of reduction of the number of learning parameters in supervised learning based on {RG} inspired hierarchical ansatzes.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03418},
	abstract = {We generalize the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm with a stack of neural network layers and evaluate its ability to sample from different topologies in a two dimensional lattice gauge theory. We demonstrate that our model is able to successfully mix between modes of different topologies, significantly reducing the computational cost required to generated independent gauge field configurations. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/saforem2/l2hmc-qcd .},
