abstract: We generalize the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm with a stack of neural
  network layers and evaluate its ability to sample from different topologies in a
  two dimensional lattice gauge theory. We demonstrate that our model is able to successfully
  mix between modes of different topologies, significantly reducing the computational
  cost required to generated independent gauge field configurations. Our implementation
  is available at https://github.com/saforem2/l2hmc-qcd .
